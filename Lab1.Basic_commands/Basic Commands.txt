T

his is our first lab of Docker.
We will learn how to run basic commands of Docker.

1. to check the status of the engie wheather it is start or not use
   --> service docker status

2. to start the service use command  
  --> service docker start

3. to check if there is any images present or not use
  --> docker images

4. to check running images use
  --> docker ps 
  --> docker ps -a (running and stopped both)

5. to create or start a image which is locally present or not use
  --> docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash (run=create+start, i=interactive mode, t=terminal)
   
   Note : always find the image at dockerhub and then use the same name in CLI. 
   
   docker has successfully pulled ubuntu image from docker hub and stored it locally 
   since it is running and running images called containers so now you are in the ubuntu container.

6. to exit the container simply use
  --> exit.

7. Now run again [docker images] and you will see ubuntu details.
   If you run this image again a new container will be create
   and the ID of both container will be different though they have same images.

8. Now if you run [docker ps -a] it will show both stopped and running containers.

9. To give name to any container use
  --> docker run -it --name Ankit centos /bin/bash

10. After exiting form above container if you run [docker images] you will have two images
    ubuntu and centos but if you run [docker ps -a] it will show three containers.

11. to download images from dockerhub to local machine for future use 
  --> docker pull jenkins/jenkins
      
12. to start a existing container use
  --> docker start Ankit[name of the containe]

13. to go inside the container use
  --> docker attach Ankit

14. to stop a running container use
  --> docker stop Ankit

15. to delete a container you must stop it first then only it will be deleted
  --> docker rm Ankit
